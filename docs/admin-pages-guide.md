Use this page when a store needs Google Shopping auto-sync enabled, disabled, or corrected with the right integration base URL.

Important:

Apps Script should handle the actual email send, unsubscribe/footer rules, and any extra delivery logging.

---

---

## Recommended daily workflow

1. Open `/admin`.
2. Check Firestore readiness and overall stats.
3. Open `/admin/checkout` for order or payment problems.
4. Open `/admin/marketplace` for public catalog visibility.
5. Open `/admin/products` for product quality issues.
6. Open `/admin/google-shopping` for sync and Merchant Center issues.
7. Open `/admin/integration-keys` for API key risks.
8. Use `/admin/marketing` only when the Apps Script webhook is configured and the audience is correct.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Page looks plain or unstyled

Confirm that `app/layout.tsx` imports the global stylesheet:

```ts
import "./globals.css";
```

Then clear Next.js cache and restart:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run dev
```

### Firestore pages show setup warnings

Check local or Vercel environment values for Firebase service account access, then restart the app.

### Marketing page says Apps Script URL is missing

Add the marketing Apps Script webhook URL to the environment and restart the app.

### New dependency was added but build fails

Run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
```

Then commit `package-lock.json` if it changed.

---

## Security reminders

- Do not commit `.env.local`.
- Do not expose Firebase service account values.
- Rotate service account keys if they are exposed.
- Do not display full API tokens in the admin UI.
- Only send marketing emails to valid audiences.
- Apps Script should enforce unsubscribe and footer rules before sending campaigns.
